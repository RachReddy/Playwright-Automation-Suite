       COMMAND                            				                           DESCRIPTION
npx playwright test 						                          		Runs all the tests in tests folder, on all browsers (chromium,firefox,webkit) in headless mode
npx playwright test example.spec.js			                  		Runs a specific test file
npx playwright test example						                      	Runs the test file which has the word example in its file name (use this when you dont recall the exact entire file name)
npx playwright test -g "test title"				                  	Runs the specific test case with the mentioned "test title"
npx playwright test --project=chromium                 				Runs on specific browser (in this case, runs the test only on chromium)
npx playwright test --headed 					                      	Runs tests in headed mode (means, you can see the physical browser whindow while executing the test) 
npx playwright test --debug			                      				Runs in debug mode, helps in trouble shooting. (When you run in debug mode, by default it runs in headed mode i.e, we can see the debug browser window)
npx playwright test example.spec.js --debug		               	Runs a specific test file in debug mode
npx playwright test example.spec.js:4 --debug		              Debug starting from a specific line no within a test


(Note: By default, all execution is done in headless mode i.e, no GUI or browser, it runs in the backend which in case of automation is an advantage as it saves memory)
